        <h2 class="Header">Humble beginnings</h2>
        <article class="description">I began my professional career in the workforce with a simple entry level position at a <em>Sonic drive in</em> in the state of Virginia. From <em>Sonic</em> I went to The <em>Dollar Store</em> and I have been there ever since. I work at an employee at the Dollar store in Highland Illinois, as well as a professional graphic artist to sustain myself while I learn code at Launchcode.</article>

<h2 class="Header">The winding road of Launchcode</h2>
<article class=”description”>My journey from Virginia to Illinois was much more than a change of location for me. I move from Virginia specifically to learn in Launchcode with the assistance of my big brother Chris Nava, who taught in Launchcode as a TA for the first unit. In the course of applying for a position at launchcode as a student, I overcame many hurdles. Just a few among them that I’ve overcome this year include: Earning a driver's license, Purchasing my first car, Getting a job in a new state, and successfully sustaining part of my income on my artistic ventures. </article>

<h2 class="Header">My aspirations</h2>
<article class="description">My aspirations when Launchcode ends is to seek an entry level position as a Technical Support Employee, and later on to enter an apprenticeship as a Front-end  Web designer. By the time I graduate here I hope to be fluent in HTML and Javascript, as well as to have made myself an awesome website and portfolio to be able to show to my future employers.</article>
